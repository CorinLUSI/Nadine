<p>A scent, a taste.... memories immediately come alive from a beautiful time full of love and joy.</p>
<p>Back then in Frankfurt, Grandma Helga magically created delicious jellies, cakes, cookies, and several other treats - all of them with that unforgettable taste that brought you back to the golden days. This signature taste reminds you of the experiences from the past, yet is still something that we are yearning for today. Memories come alive with every bite!</p>
<p>Memories of loved ones, carefree days of growing up as kids, and the feeling of being at home. These handwritten recipes from my grandmother and great-grandmother, that were safeguarded as a treasure, I consider my invaluable heritage today. These recipes preserve the valuable knowledge and wisdom of our elders for the generations to come.</p>
<p>Entire recipe books and sometimes loose leaf sheets, partially written in an old German language. Some edited with personal additions and with traces of having been lovingly used, which I myself testify were used many, many times. Being brought up by my grandparents I was allowed to collect those wonderful experiences as a child and still love remembering and dreaming about those amazing times. Passed on from generation to generation and manifested in my memory...I created this company to share with you my one-of-a-kind collection of old German delights, which is a tribute of my love for the recipes of my childhood.</p>
<p>This concept came to life out of the pure passion of my heart, lots of encouragement from friends and family, and newly discovered courage. </p>
<p>I am curious and very excited to see where this journey will lead...</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p> Anne - Marie</p>
